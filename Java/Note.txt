//  WORA : Write Once Run Anywhere
 /** int
  * byte: 1 byte -2^7 to 2^7-1
  * short: 2 bytes
  * int: 4 bytes
  * long: 8 bytes -2^63 to 2^63-1, use l for assignment, e.g., long x=113421l;
  * float: 4 bytes
  * double: 8 bytes
  * The decimal values in java is considered as double, we cannot assign float x=5.6, because 5.6 is taken as double, instead write float x=5.6f; use f
  * char: 2 bytes, java follows UNICODE and c++ follows ASCII
